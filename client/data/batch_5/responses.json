This interaction can result in negatively or badly damped wind turbine blade modes, which can have a significant effect on the turbine lifetime. The first aeroelastic problem that occurred on commercial wind turbines concerned a negatively damped edgewise mode. It is important to ensure that there is some out-of-plane deformation in this mode shape to prevent the instability. For larger turbine blades with lower torsional stiffness and the possibility of higher tip speeds for the offshore designs, classical flutter could also become relevant. When designing a wind turbine blade, it is therefore crucial that there is enough damping for the different modes and that there is no coincidence of natural frequencies with excitation frequencies (resonance). An effective aeroelastic analysis is also important, and the tools used for such an analysis must include the necessary detail in the structural model.","How old are you?":"18-30","How often do you use a search engine?":"Once-a-day","The search engine was simple to use":"neutral","Transparency in search results made it easier to find relevant documents":"neutral","Finding relevant results to searches was intuitive":"agree","The results from the search engine are an accurate representation of the truth":"strongly-agree","The application clearly explains the rankings of the results":"agree","Transparency in search results helped to find relevant documents quickly":"neutral","It is clear why a certain result is ranked higher than another results":"strongly-agree","The rankings of the search results coresponded to how trustworthy they were":"neutral","Any additional thoughts or comments on the experiment?":"Nice experiment"}

Static aeroelastic phenomena that exclude inertial forces are characterised by the unidirectional deformation of the structure, whereas dynamic aeroelastic phenomena that include inertial forces are typical in their oscillatory property of structure deformation.","How old are you?":"18-30","How often do you use a search engine?":"Once-a-day","The search engine was simple to use":"neutral","Transparency in search results made it easier to find relevant documents":"agree","Finding relevant results to searches was intuitive":"agree","The results from the search engine are an accurate representation of the truth":"strongly-agree","The application clearly explains the rankings of the results":"strongly-agree","Transparency in search results helped to find relevant documents quickly":"neutral","It is clear why a certain result is ranked higher than another results":"agree","The rankings of the search results coresponded to how trustworthy they were":"neutral","Any additional thoughts or comments on the experiment?":"Nice experiement"}
