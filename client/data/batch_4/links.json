","aircraft flutter .   the term flutter is used here to denote maintained or violent oscillations of a structure due to aerodynamic forces acting in conjunction with both elastic and inertial forces . attention is restricted to this particular branch of the more general field of aeroelasticity, which embraces buffeting, divergence, and reversal of control, as well as flutter,. airscrew flutter is not specifically considered .  the monograph is divided into three main parts, each of which has been made self-contained for the convenience of readers .   in the first part, general methods for the investigation of aircraft flutter, by theoretical analysis and by experiments on flutter models, are set out and discussed .  a detailed account of the aerodynamic theory of wings in non-uniform motion is not included, since this has already been provided elsewhere, but methods for the evaluation of the aerodynamic forces required in a theoretical flutter analysis are logically developed, and a bibliography of researches on the aerodynamic theory is given in the appendix .  investigations on specific types of aircraft flutter--namely wing flutter, control surface flutter, and tab flutter--are discussed in part these various types of flutter are considered, but the practical details of flutter-prevention devices are omitted .  finally, in part 3, methods for the experimental determination of airloads on oscillating aerofoil systems are described, and available airload measurements are analysed and compared with theoretical results .   an attempt has been made to refer in the text to all relevant british work reported by the early part of 1947 .  foreign work has been mentioned in parts 1 and 2 only where necessary for the sake of completeness, but in part 3 and the appendix all relevant foreign references known to the author have been included .   matrix notation has been used for the theoretical treatment in part 1, but otherwise its use has been avoided .

","the estimation of fatigue damage on structural elements .   a method is presented for the estimation of fatigue damage to aircraft structural elements .  the gust spectrum to which the aircraft is subjected is analysed in terms of infinitesimal loading intervals . gust data supplied by j. taylor for flying below 15,000 ft are used to study fatigue damage in a number of aircraft structural joints and one whole structure . "],["theory of aircraft structural models subjected to aerodynamic heating and external loads . ","theory of aircraft structural models subjected to aerodynamic heating and external loads .   the problem of investigating the simultaneous effects of transient aerodynamic heating and external loads on aircraft structures for the purpose of determining the ability of the structure to withstand flight to supersonic speeds is studied .  by dimensional analyses it is shown that .. constructed of the same materials as the aircraft will be thermally similar to the aircraft with respect to the flow of heat through the structure will be similar to those of the aircraft when the structural model is constructed at the same temperature as the aircraft . external loads will be similar to those of the aircraft . subjected to heating and cooling that correctly simulate the aerodynamic heating of the aircraft, except with respect to angular velocities and angular accelerations, without requiring determination of the heat flux at each point on the surface and its variation with time . acting on the aerodynamically heated structural model to those acting on the aircraft is determined for the case of zero angular velocity and zero angular acceleration, so that the structural model may be subjected to the external loads required for simultaneous simulation of stresses and deformations due to external loads . "],["on the ground level disturbance from large aircraft flying at supersonic speeds . ","on the ground level disturbance from large aircraft flying at supersonic speeds .   the whitham-walkden theory for the estimation of the strength of shock waves at ground level from aircraft flying at supersonic speeds is applied to the case of a typical projected supersonic civil transport aeroplane .   if a figure of 2 lb sq.ft. (including a factor of 2 for ground reflection) is taken as an upper limit for the acceptable strength of the bow wave from such an aircraft it is shown that restrictions on the climb and flight plan will be involved .  the advantage of the employment of larger engines with or without afterburning is discussed, with reference also to the penalties involved owing to the increase in weight of the aircraft and its direct operating costs .   finally it is suggested that an aircraft of given volume could be designed, by suitable choice of thickness and lift distribution, to minimise the strength of the shock waves in the far field . "],["some low speed problems of high speed aircraft . ","some low speed problems of high speed aircraft . the first part of the paper deals with the low speed aerodynamics of aircraft shapes suggested by kuchemann, at the second international congress in aeronautical sciences at zurich in 1960, as suitable for achieving a required range at supersonic speeds, namely wingbody arrangements with sweepback angles of 55degrees or 60degrees and streamwise thickness-chord ratio of about 5 per cent suitable for low supersonic speed, and slender near-triangular wings with sharp leading edges suitable for mach numbers of about 2 or more . no attention is given to /slewed/ wings, powered lift or variable geometry . in dealing briefly with swept wings, the need for avoiding separation of  flow from the leading edge is demonstrated, with the conclusion that it  is desirable to use leading edge flaps with blowing or suction at the knee together with blown trailing edge flaps . wind tunnel tests are described on a simplified model with these boundary layer control methods applied . mention is made of the possibility of adverse ground effect on maximum lift . more attention is given to the case of slender wings because their use involves a new type of flow with separation from all edges . this flow and its steadiness are therefore discussed from the point of view of the possibility of buffeting,. the effect of plan form on static longitudinal stability and pitch-up is analysed,. and a short summary of  available results on damping in pitch is given . large rolling moments due to sideslip are shown to give rise to serious problems of control, and the present state of knowledge of static lateral and directional stability and rolling and yawing rotary derivatives is discussed . finally the effects of proximity to the ground are summarised . the second part of the paper is concerned with work aimed at clarifying some of the requirements for handling qualities of future aircraft . it is not so much concerned with forecasts of the dynamic behaviour of these future aircraft as with determining what the pilot wants . two aspects of control in the vertical plane are discussed in some detail namely speed control and glide path holding . flight tests on an avro 707a aircraft, with artificially worsened characteristics, are described, and it is shown that substantially constant performance in the piloting task can be achieved at the expense of increased pilot effort .  some tentative conclusions on desirable levels of speed stability and phugoid damping are, nevertheless, drawn . a brief review of the present status of lateral/directional handling requirements, using mainly american data, is also included .

","the problem of obtaining high lift-drag ratios at supersonic speeds . the importance of the lift to drag ratio is well known to all aircraft designers since it gives, to a great extent, the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane . aerodynamic efficiency, however, is only one component of the grand compromise that a completed airplane represents .  at subsonic speeds, lift-drag ratios of well over 200 have been measured in wind tunnels on airfoil sections., but few powered aircraft have attained (lift to drag ratio) value of 20 .  it is invariably true that the requirements of stability and control, structure, and flight operation all contribute to reducing the design (lift to drag ratio) considerably below those exotic values which can be predicted from unrestricted aerodynamic theory .  if, however, a certain range or operating efficiency is required, there is most certainly a minimum if we examine the range equation we see that range is proportional to the lift-drag ratio, the thermopropulsive efficiency, and the logarithm of the initial to final weight ratio .  the appearance of the lift-drag ratio as a linear factor in the range equation indicates that every attempt should be made to increase (lift to drag ratio)., however, the search for higher (lift to drag ratio) may lead to strange and unorthodox configurations .  most frequently, such configurations are ruled out by the adverse effects of their geometry on the weight ratios .  in the present paper, we will deal with the maximum lift-drag ratio problem for conventional configurations having a wing and a body in close proximity to each other .  no attempt will be made to select a particular configuration as being the best .  however, the promising direction to go from the aerodynamic view will be stressed with the understanding that the other factors may outweight the aerodynamics .

(a similar, but not quite as general, method was derived by walkden in ref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the volume term, has been used extensively to predict the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies and the agreement with experiment has, so far, been quite reasonable .  the test data obtained to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft. altitude and the calculations of this paper show that under those conditions the shock noise of the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases, be dominated by the volume term .  it is shown that at higher altitudes lifting effects will dominate for even the small fighter and they will dominate over most of the altitude range for large bomber and supersonic transport aircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases with altitude as which compares to in the volume case (=pressure at altitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number, wing loading, wing plan shape and lift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating the shock noise due to combined volume and lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to configurations with wings located towards the rear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift) or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting volume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is presented from which rapid estimates can be made of the shock noise of lifting wing-body combinations .

"],["an investigation of lifting effects on the intensity of sonic booms . ","an investigation of lifting effects on the intensity of sonic booms .   this paper is a brief summary of an investigation made to check the effect of lift on the shock noise of aircraft flying at supersonic speeds .  the method of hayes has been combined with the theory of whitham to predict the asymptotic shock strength of wings carrying lift and of combinations of bodies and lifting wings .  (a similar, but not quite as general, method was derived by walkden in ref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the volume term, has been used extensively to predict the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies and the agreement with experiment has, so far, been quite reasonable .  the test data obtained to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft. altitude and the calculations of this paper show that under those conditions the shock noise of the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases, be dominated by the volume term .  it is shown that at higher altitudes lifting effects will dominate for even the small fighter and they will dominate over most of the altitude range for large bomber and supersonic transport aircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases with altitude as which compares to in the volume case (=pressure at altitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number, wing loading, wing plan shape and lift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating the shock noise due to combined volume and lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to configurations with wings located towards the rear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift) or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting volume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is presented from which rapid estimates can be made of the shock noise of lifting wing-body combinations .

(3) using the equivalence the flow field produced by heat addition and by magnetohydrodynamical body forces can be computed .   examples for a two-dimensional flat plate, a delta wing, an axially symmetric slender body, and a wedge-shaped afterbody are computed at subsonic and supersonic speeds . the efficiency of lift or thrust production by surface heat addition is very low at subsonic speeds .  at supersonic speeds the efficiency is compared with the efficiency of a conventional turbojet-powered aircraft configuration .  it is found that the efficiency of lift or thrust production by heat addition on two-dimensional bodies is approximately the same as that for a turbojet-powered two-dimensional body .  the efficiency is somewhat higher at low supersonic mach numbers and behaves as, decreasing to a constant value as increases . on the other hand, the efficiency of thrust production by heat addition increases linearly with mach number when heat is added on the rear surface of an axially symmetric afterbody of parabolic shape .
