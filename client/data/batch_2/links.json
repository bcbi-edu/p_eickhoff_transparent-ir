","heat transfer to bodies traveling at high speed in the upper atmosphere . a general method has been developed, using the methods of kinetic theory, whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated for steady flight at any speed in a rarefied gas .  the particular solution was made for a flat plate., however, the calculations can be easily extended to bodies of arbitrary shape . it was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence of solar radiation, that is, for the case of nocturnal flight, becomes of negligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up to steady flight speeds of 36,000 feet per second .  the effect of solar radiation, for the case of daytime flight, becomes increasingly important as the flight altitude is increased .  at an altitude of 150 miles and higher, solar radiation is the predominating factor that determines skin temperature .  owing to the strong effect of solar radiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes, the desirability of nocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperatures . in order to maintain low skin temperatures, it was found that the angle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path should be kept as small as possible .  this may be accomplished in practice by designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body at small angles of attack . it is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuring thermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positive and negative angles with respect to the flight path .  as much surface as possible should be inclined at negative angles .  practically, this may be accomplished by boattailing the body . in the event that an internal skin-cooling system is employed, it is shown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order of magnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturally by emitted radiation .  if the cooling rate is below the natural radiation rate, cooling has little effect upon skin temperatures . it is shown that, in the case of a missile designed to fly over a wide range of altitudes and speeds, it is desirable to make the emissivity of the skin as high as possible .  this conclusion, however, is based upon a skin surface for which the emissivity is independent of the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energy . a possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated by the decrease in skin temperature which accompanies a decrease in thermal accommodation coefficient .  this phenomenon may be used to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodation coefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin .

","some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbody combination .   the aerodynamic problems associated with propulsion-system installations have assumed a role of vital importance in the development of supersonic aircraft .  although air-induction systems have received moderate attention in the literature, considerably less information can be found on the design and installation of turbojet exit nozzles .  this condition should not be interpreted to indicate a lack of problems in jet-exit design .   as flight speeds reach supersonic levels, it becomes increasingly difficult to achieve nozzle installations which are efficient over the entire speed range .  the difficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals of high jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not always compatible .  in many of the compromise solutions, it is generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzle and afterbody performance .  rather they must be treated as a unit, and the complex effects of jet interaction with the external stream must be taken into account .  to accomplish this, the nozzle and air-frame designers must closely coordinate their efforts .   some of the aerodynamic problems of nozzle afterbody combinations are outlined in this report . particular attention is devoted to the influence of the jet-stream interaction on both nozzle thrust and after-body drag .  for this purpose, use is made of shock- boundary-layer-interaction concepts .  this approach, although not precise, correctly predicts many trends and is generally enlightening . "],["some structural and aerelastic considerations of high speed flight . ","some structural and aerelastic considerations of high speed flight .   the dominating factors in structural design of high-speed aircraft are thermal and aeroelastic in origin .  the subject matter is concerned largely with a discussion of these factors and their interrelation with one another .  a summary is presented of some of the analytical and experimental tools available to aeronautical engineers to meet the demands of high-speed flight upon aircraft structures .  the state of the art with respect to heat transfer from the boundary layer into the structure, modes of failure under combined load as well as thermal inputs and acrothermoelasticity is discussed .  methods of attacking and alleviating structural and aeroelastic problems of high-speed flight are summarized .  finally, some avenues of fundamental research are suggested .
