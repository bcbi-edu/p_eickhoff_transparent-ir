              <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
              <p>
                <b>
                  Your task is to answer the following prompt:
                </b>
                What are the structural and aeroelastic problems associated with flight of high speed aircraft?
              </p>
              <p>
                You are given a collection of documents about airplanes and aeronautics.
                There is a search bar where you can make queries to search for documents.
              </p>
              <img src="images/search-bar.png" title="search bar" vspace="50" width="80%" height="80%" />
              <p>
                One the left-hand side, you will see the document titles and an abstract.
                The abstract will highlight any words inside your query.
              </p>
              <img src="/images/results.png" title="results" vspace="50" width="70%" height="70%"/>
              <p>
                  Additionally, you can click on the title (which is a link) to view the entire article.
                  In order to go back to the search results, you can hit the "Back" button above the article (as shown in the picture below).
                  <b>
                    Please ONLY use this back button to go back to the search results. If you try to go back using something
                    other than this "back button", you may have to start the experiment over or your results may be invalidated.
                  </b>
              </p>
              <img src="/images/doc.png" title="doc" vspace="50" width="80%" height="80%"/>

              <p>
                On the right-hand side, you will see stacked bar graphs depicting the score of each keyword in your query for each respective search result.
                The larger the stacked bar graph, the more relevant that article is to your query. 
                In the image below, the first article has a greater relevance score than the second and third articles.
              </p>

              <p>
                The stacked bar graph is made up of several bars, each of which represents a word in your query.
                The legend can be seen near the top of the page.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a word does not appear in the bar graph, that means that it does not appear in that article.
                In the image below, the word "here" appears in the first three articles, but not in the last article.
                The score is calculated using the BM25 algorithm, which ranks the importance of each word in a query.
                The higher the score of a word, the more relevant that word is to that article.
              </p>
              <img src="/images/bars.png" title="bars" vspace="50" width="80%" height="80%"/>
              <p>
                If you find articles relevant to the prompt you can star them by pressing the star button.
                Stars that are "yellow" means that the article is selected as a relevant document.
                For example, the first element is marked as relevant, but the second one is not.
                You will <b>gain additional pay depending on the quality of the documents you marked as relevant. </b>
              </p>
              <img src="/images/favorites.png" title="favorites" vspace="50" width="30%" height="30%"/>
              <p>
                When you are finished with the study, hit the "Finished with Study" button at the top left.
                Once you hit finished, you <b>ill not be able to go back.</b>
              </p>
              <img src="/images/finished.png" title="finished" vspace="50" width="90%" height="90%"/>
            <p>
              At the end of the the experiment, you will be given a multiple choice quiz to verify that you have gained knowledge in this task.
              You must answer 75% percent of the questions correctly to complete the task and get your reward code. However, if you do not pass,
              you will be redirected back to the search engine, where you will have another chance to search the database again. <b>Note that the less
              times you are redirected back to the search engine, the more money you will earn at the end.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Hit the continue button below to begin the experiment.
