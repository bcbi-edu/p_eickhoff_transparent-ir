              <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
              <p>
                <b>
                  Your task is to answer the following prompt:
                </b>
                What are the structural and aeroelastic problems associated with flight of high speed aircraft?
                This includes problems with nozzle design, acoustics, and increasing the mach number.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are given a collection of documents about airplanes and aeronautics.
                There is a search bar where you can make queries to search for documents.
              </p>
              <!-- <img src="images/search-bar.png" title="search bar" vspace="50" width="80%" height="80%" /> -->
              <p>
                One the left-hand side, you will see the document titles and an abstract.
                The abstract will highlight any words inside your query.
              </p>
              <img src="/images/results.png" title="results" vspace="50" width="70%" height="70%"/>
              <p>
                  Additionally, you can click on the title (which is a link) to view the entire article.
                  In order to go back to the search results, you can hit the "Back" button above the article (as shown in the picture below).
                  <b>
                    Please ONLY use this back button to go back to the search results. If you try to go back using something
                    other than this "back button", you may have to start the experiment over or your results may be invalidated.
                  </b>
              </p>
              <img src="/images/doc.png" title="doc" vspace="50" width="80%" height="80%"/>
              <p>
                If you find articles relevant to the prompt you can star them by pressing the star button.
                Stars that are "yellow" means that the article is selected as a relevant document.
                For example, the first element is marked as relevant, but the second one is not.
                You will <b>gain additional pay depending on the quality of the documents you marked as relevant. </b>
              </p>
              <img src="/images/favorites.png" title="favorites" vspace="50" width="30%" height="30%"/>
              <p>
                There is also a menu at the top left corner. If you click on it, it will reveal all of the documents that you have
                starred. Additionally, you can review the task if you need to read it again.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you are finished with the study, hit the "Finished with Study" button at the top left.
                Once you hit finished, you <b>will not be able to go back.</b>
              </p>
              <img src="/images/finished.png" title="finished" vspace="50" width="90%" height="90%"/>
            <p>
              At the end of the the experiment, you will be given a multiple choice quiz to verify that you have gained knowledge in this task.
              You must answer at least 75% of the questions correctly to complete the task and get your reward code. However, if you do not pass,
              you will be redirected back to the search engine, where you will have another chance to search the database again. You will earn a base pay
              of $0.50 for completing this task. You can also get a bonus pay of $0.30 if you finish the study and complete the verification task on the first try.
              Each subsequent attempt on the verification survey will reduce the bonus pay by $.10. <b>If you attempt the survey three times and fail on the third try,
              you will receive no reward code and no payout</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>WARNING: </b> The queries you search for, links you favorite, and time it takes for you to complete the experiment are all recorded.
              If it appears that you have not made an honest attempt at the experiment, your experiment will be rejected and you will receive <b> no payout.</b>
              The following scenarios are examples that would lead to a rejected survey:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Zero links favorited</li>
              <li>Zero queries made</li>
              <li>Zero documents viewed</li>
              <li>Any signs of cheating or dishonest attempts at the experiment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <b>IF YOU ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE VERFICATION SURVEY WITHOUT SERIOUS USE OF THE SEARCH SYSTEM, YOUR CODE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED</b>
            </p>
